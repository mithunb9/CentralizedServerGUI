# Centralized Server GUI

This is an implementation of a centralized server GUI using Vite, React, and TypeScript. The GUI is designed to be used with the TSummer's Centralized Server.

## To get started with the project:

Make sure you have npm installed. I recommend you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your node versions. You can then install the latest version of node by running:

```bash
nvm install lts/iron
nvm use lts/iron
```

Then, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install --global yarn

yarn
```

You can now run the file by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```
